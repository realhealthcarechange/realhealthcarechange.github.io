## Do We Really Want to Fix Healthcare?

The US healthcare delivery system is seriously broken by virtually any standard.
The Commonwealth Fund (2013) ranks the US 11 th out of 11 developed countries
in overall healthcare – including quality, access, equity and efficiency while the
Bloomberg Healthcare Efficiency Index (2014) ranks the US 50 th out of 55
countries. Unfortunately, the ongoing Congressional healthcare debate centers
on the cost of health insurance. Proponents of “repeal and replace ACA” argue
that competition among insurance companies will lower insurance premiums. It
does not address healthcare cost, the primary driver of insurance premiums.
Similarly, it does not address quality, access or equity.

### Healthcare Spending:

The United States spends $3.2 trillion or 17.8% (2015) of GDP on healthcare. That
is 50% more than Sweden (11.9%), the next highest. A more staggering statistic is
that US healthcare expenditures are 27% of global healthcare expenditures
although it has only 4.3% of the world’s population.

### Healthcare Access, Equity and Efficiency:

Even with disproportionate healthcare spending, the US is the only OECD member
nation (of 35) that does not provide universal healthcare. All UN member nations
have committed to attempting to achieve universal health coverage by 2030. The
European Social Charter, “seen as the Social Constitution of Europe” guarantees
healthcare as a right. Juxtapose these commitments with the US: Over 10% of
non-elderly people in the US, primarily poor to moderate income individuals, have
no access to healthcare. That number is expected to grow to over 15% if a similar
version of the recently withdrawn AHCA (American Health Care Act) is passed. A
US government website, Healthypeople.gov, acknowledges that those without
access are more likely to die younger and to have poorer health status. Brookings
Institution research shows that the disparity in life expectancy between the
highest and lowest 10% in mid-career income has increased from 5 years to 14 years
for men born in 1920 versus 1950. For women, the gap has increased from 4.7 to 13 years.

### Why Does the US Spend So Much on Healthcare?

Academics and pundits offer a broad range of explanations and justifications for
the differential cost and rankings of US healthcare. Politicians look to lay blame
anywhere that does not require challenging the status quo in healthcare delivery.
Industry executives, physicians’ groups and trade associations offer explanations
that are purely self-interested. They are part of the problem set rather than the
solution. No individual or group has offered pragmatic, comprehensive, economically
viable solutions.

Population healthcare delivery is extremely complex. As President Trump so
wisely acknowledged, “nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated.”
However, unless we ask difficult questions that challenge the status quo, it is
unlikely that viable solutions will evolve. It is also unlikely that an incrementalist,
rather than disruptive, approach to US healthcare delivery problems will achieve
universal access, equity, efficiency and quality commensurate with current
spending rates or reduced spending.

### The Fallacy of the AHCA Health Insurance Arguments

Proponents of the proposed AHCA legislation argued that it would lead to:
1.  Lower insurance premiums;
2.  Increased competition among insurers; and,
3.  Greater healthcare choice for individuals.

They do not address healthcare costs, efficiency, access, equity or quality.
Likewise, they do not acknowledge that insurance premiums cannot be reduced
without either:

1.  Eliminating certain insured services;
2.  Reducing the fees paid for services;
3.  Eliminating coverage for less healthy persons; and / or,
4.  Transferring much of the cost of healthcare to individuals.

They do not acknowledge that healthcare access and healthcare choice is, and will
remain, unavailable except to those who can afford it under AHCA or similar
variants. Gross US median household income is $55,775. For a family of four
using standard deductions and a 5.5% estimated marginal state tax rate, after tax
median household income is $45,729. Estimated 2016 per capita US healthcare
spending exceeds $10,000. If the $10,000 is adjusted for the 10% of the US
population without healthcare access, the per capita spending is in excess of
$11,100.

### The Insurance Provider Business Model

Insurance companies charge a fee (premium) to assume risk (healthcare
expenses) that would otherwise be the responsibility of the insured. The price
charged for assuming risk is purely a function of the expected payout on behalf of
the insured. Consistent with both theoretical and practical approaches to risk-
bearing, the greater the risk that is assumed, the more insurance companies
expect to be compensated for taking risk. Since the amount of future payouts
(claims) is unknown, insurance companies must estimate their potential claims
expense using statistical analyses and forecasts of the health and demographics of
the individuals or groups being insured. Once the potential morbidity of the
insured is determined, the expected payments for diagnosis and treatment of
disease must be estimated. Premiums are based upon those expected payouts.

Insurance companies pay claims based upon contractual fee-for- service
agreements with healthcare providers in the insurance companies’ networks.
Further, the expected payouts for specific services vary based upon specific
insurance plan agreements. Plan agreements define covered services, copays,
and deductibles for both in- and out-of- network providers. Copays, deductibles
and self-insured services can be viewed as the mechanisms by which the insured
shares in the risk or reduces risk to the insurer.

Insurance premiums are expected to cover all claims, operating expenses and
profit (surplus for non-profits) of insurance companies. The primary determinant
of premiums is the expected claims payout (risk) assumed by the insurance
company. The only way to reduce insurance premiums is to reduce risk. There are
only a few methods through which risk reduction can be effected at the
individual insured level:

1.  Elimination of specific covered services including the "Ten Essential Services"
covered under ACA (Affordable Care Act / Obamacare):
  1.  Ambulatory Patient Services (Outpatient Care);
  2.  Emergency Services (Trips to Emergency Room);
  3.  Hospitalization (Inpatient Care);
  4.  Maternity and Newborn Care;
  5.  Mental Health Services and Addiction Care (The National Institute of
    Mental Health estimates that 25% of the US population has a diagnosable
    mental illness and at least 10% are taking anti-depressants.
    The current opioid epidemic is well documented.);
  6. Prescription Drugs;
  7. Rehabilitative Services and Devices;
  8. Laboratory Services;
  9. Preventive Healthcare, Wellness and Chronic Disease Treatment;
and,
  10. Pediatric Services.

2.  Increase of risk borne by the insured through increased copays, deductibles
and self-insured services;
3.  Reduction of reimbursement rates for covered services;
4.  Elimination of insurance for persons judged to be high-risk and / or with pre-
existing conditions;
5.  Taking a portfolio approach to risk by insuring groups comprised of high- and
low-risk individuals (such as the ACA Individual Mandate); and / or,
6.  Entering into reinsurance programs to cap potential claims / losses.
Reinsurance, unless government backed, would probably not have a dramatic
effect on overall health insurance premiums since both the primary and re-
insurer would be evaluating and pricing the same risks.

### Competition and Consumer Healthcare Choice

AHCA supporters argued that it would provide individuals with greater healthcare
choice due to competition. The real questions are:

1.  What choices?
2.  What competition?
3.  What information is available on which to make an informed decision about
available healthcare options?

Since there is nothing in the recent healthcare debates that considers the actual
cost of healthcare versus the costs of health insurance, it can only be assumed
that “choice” and “competition” are specifically associated with health insurance.
The foregoing described the process though which insurance companies evaluate
and price risk. Therefore, it is unlikely that identical covered services, morbidity
risk, copays and deductibles would be priced significantly differently by insurers.
Therefore, only differential rates paid by insurers to specific service providers
(provider network) will impact price, eliminating competition as a mechanism for
reducing insurance premiums.

There are many economic theories that address consumer choice under a variety
of conditions. Virtually all assume some knowledge base or information set upon
which informed choices can be made. However, lack of objective information
about quality and price among healthcare providers limits the extent to which
informed choice can be made.

It appears that the only real choices that consumers have under the AHCA
proposal are whether or not to purchase insurance and, if so, what services,
copays and deductibles to select. AHCA eliminates the ACA requirement that
certain services be covered by all insurance policies. Unfortunately, lack of
information discussed above, will leave many people underinsured even though
they technically have health insurance.

On whether or not to purchase insurance, the choice for many Americans is
whether to pay for necessities or health insurance. ACA income-based subsidies
limited health insurance costs to a percentage of income. AHCA age-based tax
credits do not come close to covering the cost of health insurance. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that under the new legislation, the
uninsured population in the US will grow from 28 million to 52 million by 2026.
For that 15% of the population, there is no choice, no access to healthcare and no
equity.

### Who Is Responsible for the State of Healthcare Delivery in the US?

The title of this article is “Do We Really Want to Fix Healthcare?”. That raises five
basic questions:
1.  Who is “We”?
2.  Who is responsible for the current state of US healthcare delivery?
3.  Is healthcare a right or a privilege?
4.  How can US healthcare costs be decreased while improving quality,
access, and equity?
5.  Who pays?

**The US healthcare delivery system must be fixed.**
